But yet Ile make assurance: double sure,
And take a Bond of Fate: thou shalt not liue,
That I may tell pale-hearted Feare, it lies;
And sleepe in spight of Thunder.</p><p>Thunder 3 Apparation, a Childe Crowned, with a Tree in his hand.</p><p>What is this, that rises like the issue of a King,
And weares vpon his Baby-brow, the round

Who chafes, who frets, or where Conspirers are:

His secret Murthers sticking on his hands,
Now minutely Reuolts vpbraid his Faith-breach:
Those he commands, moue onely in command,
Nothing in loue: Now do's he feele his Title
Hang loose about him, like a Giants Robe
Vpon a dwarfish Theefe</p><p>Ment. Who then shall blame
His pester'd Senses to recoyle, and start,
When all that is within him, do's condemne

To giue Obedience, where 'tis truly ow'd:
Meet we the Med'cine of the sickly Weale,
And with him poure we in our Countries purge,
Each drop of vs</p><p>Lenox. Or so much as it needes,
To dew the Soueraigne Flower, and drowne the Weeds:
Make we our March towards Birnan.</p><p>Exeunt. marching.</p><p>Scaena Tertia.</p><p>Enter Macbeth, Doctor, and Attendants.</p></div> </div>

That Nature giues way to in repose.
Enter Macbeth, and a Seruant with a Torch.</p><p>Giue me my Sword: who's there?
Macb. A Friend</p><p>Banq. What Sir, not yet at rest? the King's a bed.
He hath beene in vnusuall Pleasure,
And sent forth great Largesse to your Offices.
This Diamond he greetes your Wife withall,
By the name of most kind Hostesse,
And shut vp in measurelesse content</p><p>Mac. Being vnprepar'd,
Our will became the seruant to defect,
Which else should free haue wrought</p><p>Banq. All's well.
I dreamt last Night of the three weyward Sisters:
To you they haue shew'd some truth</p><p>Macb. I thinke not of them:
Yet when we can entreat an houre to serue,
We would spend it in some words vpon that Businesse,
If you would graunt the time</p><p>Banq. At your kind'st leysure</p><p>Macb. If you shall cleaue to my consent,
When 'tis, it shall make Honor for you</p></div> </div>

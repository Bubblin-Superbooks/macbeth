Lady. To bed, to bed: there's knocking at the gate:
Come, come, come, come, giue me your hand: What's
done, cannot be vndone. To bed, to bed, to bed.</p><p>Exit Lady.</p><p>Doct. Will she go now to bed?
Gent. Directly</p><p>Doct. Foule whisp'rings are abroad: vnnaturall deeds
Do breed vnnaturall troubles: infected mindes
To their deafe pillowes will discharge their Secrets:
More needs she the Diuine, then the Physitian:
God, God forgiue vs all. Looke after her,
Remoue from her the meanes of all annoyance,
And still keepe eyes vpon her: So goodnight,
My minde she ha's mated, and amaz'd my sight.
I thinke, but dare not speake</p><p>Gent. Good night good Doctor.</p><p>Exeunt.</p><p>Scena Secunda.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Drum and Colours. Enter Menteth, Cathnes,</p></div> </div>

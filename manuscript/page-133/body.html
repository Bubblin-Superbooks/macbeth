If thou beest slaine, and with no stroake of mine,
My Wife and Childrens Ghosts will haunt me still:
I cannot strike at wretched Kernes, whose armes
Are hyr'd to beare their Staues; either thou Macbeth,
Or else my Sword with an vnbattered edge
I sheath againe vndeeded. There thou should'st be,
By this great clatter, one of greatest note
Seemes bruited. Let me finde him Fortune,
And more I begge not.</p><p>Exit. Alarums.</p><p>Enter Malcolme and Seyward.</p><p>Sey. This way my Lord, the Castles gently rendred:

The Noble Thanes do brauely in the Warre,

<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Banq. Looke to the Lady:
And when we haue our naked Frailties hid,
That suffer in exposure; let vs meet,
And question this most bloody piece of worke,
To know it further. Feares and scruples shake vs:
In the great Hand of God I stand, and thence,
Against the vndivulg'd pretence, I fight
Of Treasonous Mallice</p><p>Macd. And so doe I</p><p>All. So all</p><p>Macb. Let's briefely put on manly readinesse,
And meet i'th' Hall together</p><p>All. Well contented.</p><p>Exeunt.</p><p>Malc. What will you doe?
Let's not consort with them:
To shew an vnfelt Sorrow, is an Office
Which the false man do's easie.
Ile to England</p><p>Don. To Ireland, I:
Our seperated fortune shall keepe vs both the safer:
Where we are, there's Daggers in mens smiles;
The neere in blood, the neerer bloody</p></div> </div>
